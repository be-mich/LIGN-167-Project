# LIGN-167-Project
My project for LIGN 167 (Winter 2022). LIGN 167 is on Deep Learning for Natural Language Understanding.

The aim of this project is to create a ChatBot with the personality of comedian John Mulaney. 
The ChatBot will be constructed using DialoGPT model, and fine-tuning this pretrained response generation model on transcripts of John Mulaney jokes. 
The transcripts will be obtained from Youtube, and will be focused primarily on comedic material written by John Mulaney as opposed to other comedic work he has participated in.
