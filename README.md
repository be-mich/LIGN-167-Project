# LIGN-167-Project
My project for LIGN 167 (Winter 2022). LIGN 167 is on Deep Learning for Natural Language Understanding.

The aim of this project is to create a ChatBot with the personality of Seinfeld character George Costanza. 
The ChatBot will be constructed using DialoGPT model, and fine-tuning this pretrained response generation model on Seinfeld scripts. 
After finetuning DialoGPT a series of experiments were conducted to assess both objective (perplexity) and subjective performance.
