        "This notebook conducts backtranslation on some of the Seinfeld data. Backtranslation is when a sentence is translated to one language and then back to it's original language. The goal of backtranslation, and of this notebook is to conduct data augmentation. Once a sentence is backtranslated, the original context is kept but the order and exact phrasing is different. Data augmentation can help our model learn more. Backtranslation is only done on a sample of the data because of computational resource limitations (google api limitations). "
